- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rosseaux 👋
- I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have skills in React.Js, Node.Js, and Python. 
- I currently reside in Melbourne, Australia, I'm 30 years old, a big fan of all things gaming, fantasy books, and guitar.
- While I've dabbled in C++ from a young age, in the last year and a half I've taken huge steps to improve on my understanding of web development.
- I'm actively seeking full time employment as a developer, my strong suit is Front End, but I do have understanding of server-side programming and Back End development.

- I would love to contribute to more open source projects and collaborate on anything and everything, if you see anything in my repositories you're curious about
or have any constructive feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
