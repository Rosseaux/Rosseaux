- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rosseaux 👋
- I'm currently progressing quickly with HTML/CSS/Javascript, and open to mentoring and Junior Developer positions
- I also have a good understanding of the fundamentals of Python.

- I currently reside in Melbourne, Australia, I'm 30 years old, a big fan of all things gaming, fantasy books, and guitar.
- While I've dabbled in C++ from a young age, in the last six months I've taken a more serious approach to HMTL/CSS/Javascript and Python, and 
am quite proud of the speed with which I've progressed. 
- In a short time I went from Hello World to building simple games in Python, and constructing simple web applications and aesthetically pleasing websites.

- I would love to contribute to more open source projects and collaborate on anything and everything, if you see anything in my repositories you're curious about
or have any constructive feedback on, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
